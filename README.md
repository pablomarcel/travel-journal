# travel-journal
Guide for travelers around the world. 

# Problem Statement (Owner: Product)
# Scope:
We travel to make us happy. Therefore, it is important for millions of travelers to be able to find an unforgettable experience without inconveniences. 

# Impact: 
Currently, travellers need to search though multiple sites to find the latest updates or travel tips. There is no "go-to" site or application for the travel community for reviewing recent user trips. If this information is lacking, travellers can find themselves in a predicament when they arrive at their destination. 

# Causes: 
When travellers are spending time fixing their travel problems, they are not spending time enjoying their trip. Consequently, the traveller will feel that they have wasted their time and money. 

# Other solutions: 
Through our application, travellers have a platform to share their experiences. Prospective travellers can then plan their trips in advance to avoid any inconveniences by using the shared content, comments, and reviews of other user's trips.
