# travel-journal
Guide for travelers around the world. 

# Problem Statement (Owner: Product)
# Scope:
We travel to make us happy. Therefore, it is important for millions of travelers to be able to find an unforgettable experience without inconveniences. 

# Impact: 
Currently, travellers need to search though multiple sites to find the latest updates or travel tips. There is no "go-to" site or application for the travel community for reviewing recent user trips. If this information is lacking, travellers can find themselves in a predicament when they arrive at their destination. 

# Causes: 
When travellers are spending time fixing their travel problems, they are not spending time enjoying their trip. Consequently, the traveller will feel that they have wasted their time and money. 

# Other solutions: 
Through our application, travellers have a platform to share their experiences. Prospective travellers can then plan their trips in advance to avoid any inconveniences by using the shared content, comments, and reviews of other user's trips.

## Overview of travel-journal website that will be built
This project is to build a blog website for travelers. It is a collection of the interesting and useful information of all favorite places where travelers have unforgettable experiences when they visited there.
Each post of any traveler will be review, comment and rating by users who are interested in the post.

## Travel Journal URL, API and Frontend

[**LINK: Travel Journal URL**](https://travel-journal-pablo.herokuapp.com/)

## Developing This API

Make sure you have version 14 or 16 of Node.js installed on your computer.
In your terminal, from inside this project directory, run npm install to install the project dependencies.
You may also need to change the directory/folder to 'frontend', and run npm install to install additional project dependencies.
Create a .env file in the root project directory with the following code: 
```
NODE_ENV = development

PORT = 8000

MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://<admin>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/travel_journal?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

JWT_SECRET = c-team2022
```
Run npm run dev to start the local server. You should see a logged statement telling you Server is listening on http://localhost:8000.
Use curl or API client of your choice to browse the various endpoints contained in this project.
